# C Compiler
This is a C Compiler I made in Python, it translates from C to x86 assembly language, I made it on Ubuntu Linux. I used GCC to assembly and preprocess the C File, then I compile it with my compiler and pass it to GAS for assembly.

These are the compiler passes I made for the compiler:
